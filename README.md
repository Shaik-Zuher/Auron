## What is Auron?
Auron-Health Activated is an advanced medical recommendation system built using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, and Machine Learning (Random Forest).
The platform provides personalized medicine recommendations based on user-reported symptoms.
It goes beyond basic recommendations, offering an upgraded experience where users can visit an official online store to purchase medicines directly.
The system also features a Reverse Medication tool, which suggests symptoms that can be treated by a particular medicine, and an Emergency Guide to assist during critical situations.
Auron-Health is designed to improve healthcare accessibility and offer timely, reliable solutions using cutting-edge technology.
